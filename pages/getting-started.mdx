# Getting Started

## Installation

### Build and add to path

`cargo b -r && cp ./target/release/tinydancer ~/.local/bin/`

### Or install using cargo

`cargo install --git https://github.com/tinydancer-io/half-baked-client tinydancer`

## Run the node

### Configure the client

To set the cluster in your config run:
`tinydancer config set --cluster Localnet`

To set the log file in your config run:
`tinydancer config set --log-path client.log`

Although setting the log file is not strictly necessary it defaults to the current
directory and creates a file called client.log.

To see the config at any point run:
`tinydancer config get`

### Start your node

The Node will start a local RPC server that acts as a relayer between your
and the external RPC.

To start the node run:
`tinydancer start <path_to_shred_archival>`

import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Callout type="info">
`<path_to_shred_archival>` is the path to the shred archival db to store the sampled shreds. It is recommended to create a dir in /mnt or /tmp
    and use that.
</Callout>

### Monitor logs for the client

To monitor the logs for the client run:
`tinydancer logs`

This will stream the logs to your terminal.

### Verify a single slot from the CLI

To verify a single slot from the CLI run:

```
tinydancer verify --slot <slot_number>
```
