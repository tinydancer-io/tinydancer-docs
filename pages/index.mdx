# Introduction
Tinydancer is an open-source **light client** implementation for the Solana blockchain. This client is used to make the solana network more **trust minimized**.

## Background
Any normal day-to-day blockchain user relies on trusted RPCs (full nodes) directly or indirectly (through wallets) to make any transactions or interact with the network. They can't run a full blockchain node inside their homes as it's expensive and infeasible. This clearly is a big issue as RPCs can lie to you or in extreme cases the entire network may collude and produce invalid transactions or blocks. This is where Tinydancer comes into the picture.
