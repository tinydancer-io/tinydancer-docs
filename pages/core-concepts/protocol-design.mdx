# Protocol Design

## Interactive
For every block processed by the network, the diet clients query the block head-
ers which should contain 2/3 of the staked votes of the nodes in the network,
indicating consensus and block confirmation. In addition to receiving the list
of validators who voted on the invalid block, clients would also get their stake
amounts adding up to super majority stake and the signatures.

Since we don’t want diet clients to store the entire ledger unlike a full node
they need access to data from the rest of the network. We assume the network
has an honest super minority and each client is at the very least connected to a
single honest full node. The diet clients would use DA Sampling for every block
as described in the above section. If the client receives all the requested shreds
from the validator and it passes merkle authentication then the client can move
on to the next stage. If not then it will proceed to request other diet clients in
the network recurrently for the missing shreds. Upon failure of these the diet
client would know that it should not trust the confirmation and data has been
either withheld and/or tampered with.

## Non-Interactive
The above protocol can be made non-interactive by embedding a deterministic
randomness function inside the validator client that takes in the Slot number
and the diet client’s ed25519 public key as seed to generate a random vector
to sample the shreds. This would eliminate the need for the diet client to
request the nodes for shreds as the nodes would directly send the shreds to that
particular diet client based on the corresponding sampled randomness.
