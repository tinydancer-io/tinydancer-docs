# Shreds
Shred is a data structure which can be referred to as the smallest unit of a block
that are sent across the network in the form of UDP packets using Turbine
Block Propagation. Shredding is the process done after creating Entries into
the ledger. Shredding is done for two reasons, one being that sending an entire
entry at once over UDP is not possible given the IPV4 MTU of 1500 bytes and
two shreds are erasure coded so they also help with packet loss and malicious
dropping of packets.

Each shred has a sub-type - coding shred and data shred. Data shreds con-
tain the ledger entries. Coding shreds are required to provide redundancy to
protect against the network dropping packets. Since there is a chance for UDP
networks to drop packets as in contrast to TCP where dropped packets are re-
transmitted, the need for having erasure coded shreds encoding the data shreds
itself is critical due to packet loss. The coding shreds also prevent any malicious
node from dropping packets while propagating the shreds.

Each Shred also has the following data layout:
 - Common Header
 - Data or Coding Header
 - Payload


import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Callout type="info">
#### Common Header
The common header contains the signature of the leader which is a signed
message originated from the merkle root of the shreds. This is used to validate
that the shreds are received from the leader and to slash the leader if the
proofs don’t compute to the root. It also contains the slot number, the shred
version and the FEC index which helps with creating the coding shreds.
</Callout>

## Data Shred
Data shreds are the individually transmitted units of the ledger entries. The
payload here contains the path of the shred to the merkle root i.e the proof and
the actual merkle root. This allows for doing equality checks without having to
reconstruct the whole block. It is important to note that this a newly imple-
mented method and the legacy method didn’t have merkle proofs in shreds.

## Coding Shred
Coding shreds store the erasure-coded data. Solana uses Reed-Solomon erasure
coding, a polynomial encoding algorithm. Given n shreds and k data shreds we
get the number of coding shreds t = n - k. The coded shreds are generated
using a generator polynomial `g(x) = (x-a)(x-a2)(x-a3). . . . . . (x-a2t)`
